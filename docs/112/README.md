# Dimensionality reduction terminology

## Ordination in reduced space

From the latin *ordinato* which means order, ordination is the
arrangement of units in some order. In the context of dimensionality
reduction, ordination refers to the arrangement of samples in a reduced space
where the distances between samples are preserved as much as possible.
This terms is widely used in statistics, and comes from ecology where 
it refers to the arrangements of objects understudy along different axes 
(Gower, 1984)[^1]

## Multidimensionnal space and reduced space
Multidimensional spaces generaly refers to the original space where the
data is represented. The reduced space is the space where the data is
represented after dimensionality reduction.

## Projection
Projection is the operation of mapping a point from a high-dimensional
space to a lower-dimensional space. In geography for example, it refers
to the representation of the earth (3D) to a flat map. It is used in
the context of dimensionality reduction to "stated" the process
of mapping the data from the original space to the reduced space.

## Axis, components and factors
The retains or extracted variables (or dimensions) in the reduced space 
are called axis, components or factors. The principal (or major) axis is generally
the axis that explains the most variance in the data, while the
secondary (or minor) axis is the axis that explains the second most
variance in the data.
