# What is dimensionnality reduction


## What is it?
Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of random
variables (i.e., dimensions) by obtaining a set of variables [(a.k.a
dimension, factors, components)](../112/README.md)
that are expected to explain most of the properties the data. It is a
key process in data exploration and preprocessing, but also in 
analysis when to goal is to understand the underlying structure of the data.

## Why it is useful?

- **Data visualization**: It is difficult to visualize data in high dimensions. 
  Dimensionality reduction allows us to visualize data in 2D or 3D.
- **Data compression**: Reducing the number of dimensions of the data can help 
  to reduce the storage space, and the computational cost of analysing
  huge data set
- **Noise reduction**: By reducing the dimensionality of the data, we can 
  remove some of the noise and redundant features that are not useful
  for the analysis.
- **Feature extraction**: Dimensionality reduction can help to identify new 
  features that are more informative than the original features by
  explaining most of the variance in the data.
- **[Curse of dimensionality]()**: High dimensional data can be difficult to 
  work with, and can lead to overfitting. Dimensionality reduction can help
  to mitigate this problem.
