# Markdown markup language

Markdown is lightweight markup language which is simple to use and
available in many programming language and applications. It's an easy
way to renders HTML pages. 

There is many *variant* or *flavors* [^ref2]. The canonical specification[^ref1] contained many ambiguities,
and it seems to have generated various markdown specific syntax and
parsers.

To explore the multiple variations, try <https://babelmark.github.io/>

I mainly use CommonMark[^ref3] and GitHub Flavored Markdown[^ref4],
with little usage of HTML and CSS. Here are some note/cheatsheet on
those :

- [Basic markdown and CommonMark](../41)
- [Some differences between Gruber's markdown and CommonMark](../42)
- [GitHub Flavored Markdown and advanced formating](../43)
- [HTML/CSS hacks](../44)
