# Markdown markup language

#markdown #hum

Markdown is lightweight markup language which is simple to use and
available in many programming language and applications. It's an easy
way to renders HTML pages. 

There is many *variant* or *flavors* [^ref2]. The canonical specification[^ref1] contained many ambiguities,
and it seems to have generated various markdown specific syntax and
parsers.

To explore the multiple variations, try <https://babelmark.github.io/>

I mainly use CommonMark[^ref3] and GitHub Flavored Markdown[^ref4],
with little usage of HTML and CSS. Here are some note/cheatsheet on
those :

- [Basic markdown and CommonMark](../41)
- [Some differences between Gruber's markdown and CommonMark](../42)
- [GitHub Flavored Markdown and advanced formating](../43)
- [HTML/CSS hacks](../44)
