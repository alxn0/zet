# Clustering process

#clustering 

According to Halkidi et al. (2001)[^ref1], the clustering process follow the folowing steps:

1. **Feature selection:** The choice of variables used for the clustering task. Try to remove irrelevant features that does not inform on underlying cluster. This step is skipped if we work directly with dissimilarities/symilarities
2. **Clustering algorithm:** Choice of the clustering criterion and therefore the clustering algorithm. We have to take into account the type of clusters that are expected to occur in the data set, but also computation complexity depending on the size of the data.
3. **Validation**: The *correctedness* of the solution is verified.
4. **Interpretation**: Integrate the clustering results in domain knowledge.
