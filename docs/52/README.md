# The collector fallacy

It's the simple idea that collecting and bookmarking pile of contents
does not brings value to knowledge work. We only accumulate, but not
process the information.

The authors' propose that an effective workflow is to 
1. Research (find content)
2. Read
3. Assimilate

Research should not take too long (less than 1 hour for the author), and
we should finish reading/assimilating everything before returning to
research.
