# Similarity in semantic search

## Classical metrics
- **Euclidean distance (L2 Distance)**
	- Distance between vectors' end
	- Magnitude (L2 / Euclidean) is sometime useful, such as in recommendation search

- **Cosine similarity**
	- Cosine the angle between vectors
	- *often* used in semantic search

- **Dot Product**
	- Cosine multiplied by lengths of both vectors
	- Dot and Cosine are equivalent when embedding are normalized to 1

## Scale
- **nearest neighbor search**
