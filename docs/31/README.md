# Intermediate-linkage clustering

In between [single](../29) and [complete](../30) linkage. The fusion criterion is satisfied when a given proportion of the total possible number
of links is reached. For example, for a criterion of 50%, a fusion happened when their is
50% of the maximum links (i.e., distance between objects at a current partition level).

Never used it ...
