# Andy Matushak Evergreen Notes

Some interesting implementation of permenant notes from Andy Matushak,
they can be accessed from this
[website](https://notes.andymatuschak.org)

He use the terme *evergreen* notes, as if they are alwais usefull, but
not simply fleeting notes.

It's kind of a mess to explore, but worthile diggine to expand the
notion of Zettlekasten.
