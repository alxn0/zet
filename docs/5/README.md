# Clustering

Cluster analysis includes a range of techniques to categorized objects. In 
simple terms, the goal is to split multiple objects in a set of groups, where 
objects in a same groups are as *similar* as possible. This general problem 
encompass many specific situation, and there a panoply of technique to realize 
clustering[^info1]. Also, there is no clear definition of what a *cluster* is, 
meanings multiple approach looking at different *representation* of clusters.

Considering the extensive number of algorithm, multiple taxonomy have
been proposed and to my knowledge, Ezugwu and al. (2022)
provides the most recent and complete one [^ref1].
