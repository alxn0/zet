# GL.Inet Slate plus as a home wifi router

I'm searching for a wifi router that is supported by openWRT
and got a toggle button that I can use WIFI AP on/off (I don't want
to use wifi to much at home to limit screen time).

The GL.Inet Slate plus seems interesting.

- It got a toggle switch
- Support openWRT[^1] with
  enough RAM [^2]
- As a USB 3.0, can easily connect an external drive
- Not that expensive (80 USD on alibaba express)
- WiFi 5 (don't need 6 for home usage)
