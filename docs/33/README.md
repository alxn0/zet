# Representations of hierarchical clustering solutions

**Dendrogram**

A dendrogram is a common way to represent hierarchical clustering results. Dendrograms will display the different step at which objects/groups are fused based. For conveniance, the length of the branch will ofently represent the partition level (i.e., the measure treshold) at which fusion happened, with perpendicual lines connecting the two branches.

**Subgraphs**

Another options is to visualize connected subgraphs at each partition level.

**Cophenetic matrix**

astly, any classification can be fully described by a [cophenetic matrix](../23), where each element of the matrix, namely the [cophenetic distances](../23), are the distance at which each pairs of objects become part of the same group.
