# Turn a RaspBerry Pi in a music streamer

tags: +raspberry\_pi +audio

I got this RaspBerry Pi 4 model B and I want to use it as a music
streamer. I got the following considerations:

- Which DAC, hat or USB
- Stream Tidal
- Stream podcast and radio
- Access to local FLAC files

I found those solutions:

- Volumio OS[^1] which support Tidal connect
- IQaudIO hat DAC[^2] with HIGHPI case[^3]
