# Application server

An application server is simply a server that runs applications, and
communicates with the clients through various protocols.

In the case of web development, the application server run behind a
web server to generate dynamic content, as it can run server-side code.

Still, many application server have embedded web servers, and can
serve static content as well. Therefore, the distinction between
web server and application server is not always clear, and sometimes
both terms are used interchangeably.
