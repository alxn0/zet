# Â§Statistical association

Association is a loosed term to describe the *ressemblance* between a set of objects or descriptors.

These includes :
 - [**dependance** or **correlation**](../15) between *descriptors*. 
 - [**(dis)similarity**](../3) which describe ressemblance between *objects*.

This duality between object and descriptor associations is described as
Q and R analyses in Legendre and Legendre (2012) chapter on Ecological
ressemblance.
