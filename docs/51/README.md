# The two Luhmann's Zettels on the Zettelkasten

1. The Zettelkasten as a septic tank - donâ€™t put in only filtered notes. Delay examining and deciding - and a question of speed.(Zettel 9/8a2)

2. The Zettelkasten with the complex digestive tract of a ruminant. All arbitrary ideas, all randomness of the reading could be included. The inner compatibility matters. (Zettel 9/8i)
