# The three types of linking in Luhmann's Zettlekasten

##  Structural outline

Used at the begining of a major line of thought. Luhmann's noted several
concepts/ideas to be addressed, already numbered accordingly and placed
close to the note containing the outline.

Like a outline or a table of content.

## Collective references

At the begining of a subject area, this cards car refers to many other
cards in the same sections (see numbering systems) or mostly far apart.

## Single references

SImple reference to another card, frequently found in another section,
in the context of another subject or discussion
