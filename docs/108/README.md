# Loss function

A loss function is a function that maps an event or values of one or more variables onto a real number, intuitively representing some "cost" associated with the event. 
The cost is the penalty for an outcome that is not accurate. In the case of model optimization, it is used to estimate how badly the model is performing, and the model is updated to minimize the loss function.

Some example:

- Linear regression, the loss function is the mean squared error between the predicted value and the actual value.
- Metric multidimensional scaling, the loss function is the stress function.
