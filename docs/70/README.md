# Prompt engineering

## What is it?

The *art* of writtings prompts in LLMs in order to get *results* that are more aligned with our *objectives*

## Strategies
- Use [predefined principles](../71) to optimize prompt
    - Write clear and specific instructions
    - Give the model time to "think"
- Adopt an [iterative](../78) approach to prompt development
- Use a [string template](../79)

## What can we do?
- Different results:
    - [Summarizing](../80) content
    - [Inferring](../81) emotions, usage, etc.
    - [Transforming](../82) language, format, tone, etc.
    - [Expanding](../83) a text for specific case-scenario
- Building a [chatbot](../84)
- [Pair programming](../85)
