# Prompt engineering

## What is it?

The *art* of writtings prompts in LLMs in order to get *results* that are more aligned with our *objectives*

## Strategies
- Use [predefined principles](../71) to optimize prompt
    - Write clear and specific instructions
    - Give the model time to "think"
- Adopt an [iterative](../78) approach to prompt development
- Use a [string template](../79)

## What can we do?
- Different results:
    - [Summarizing](../80) content
    - [Inferring](../../Data%20science/Prompt%20engineering/inferring.md) emotions, usage, etc.
    - [Transforming](../../Data%20science/Prompt%20engineering/transforming.md) language, format, tone, etc.
    - [Expanding](../../Data%20science/Prompt%20engineering/expanding.md) a text for specific case-scenario
- Building a [chatbot](../../Data%20science/Prompt%20engineering/chatbot.md)
- [Pair programming](../../Data%20science/Prompt%20engineering/pair_programming_scenario.md)
